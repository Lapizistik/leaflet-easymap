# Leasymap (Leaflet Easymap)

Leasymap is a  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) based library for
integrating ([OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.de)) maps in webpages without programming.

## Examples
See [the showcase](https://lapizistik.github.io/leaflet-easymap/) with examples of customization by options.

## Usage

Have a look at the [source code](simple.html) of [simple.html](https://lapizistik.github.io/leaflet-easymap/simple.html). You only need a copy of [js/leaflet-easymap.js](https://lapizistik.github.io/leaflet-easymap/js/leaflet-easymap.js). If you want to use geojson with maki markers you will also need the contents of the maki/icons directory

## Todo
* Improve documentation: detailled descriptions for all options
* Add support for marker types (maki, awesome markers, â€¦)
* Add support for layer groups with different contents.
* Improve code quality, clean up code.
