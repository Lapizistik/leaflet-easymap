# Leaflet Easymap

Easymap is a  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) based library for integrating
([OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.de)) maps in webpages without programming.

## Examples
* `index.html` (<https://lapizistik.github.io/leaflet-easymap/>) gives a very reduced example
* `advanced.html`(<https://lapizistik.github.io/leaflet-easymap/advanced.html>) has showcases for customizing with options

## Todo
* Improve documentation: detailled descriptions for all options
* Add support for marker types (maki, awesome markers, â€¦)
* Add support for layer groups with different contents.
* Improve code quality, clean up code.
